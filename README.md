## Introduction to GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) platform that allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your GitHub repository.

### Key Concepts

- **Workflow**: Automated process made up of one or more jobs, defined in YAML files under `.github/workflows/`.
- **Job**: A set of steps that execute on the same runner.
- **Step**: An individual task, such as running a script or an action.
- **Action**: A reusable extension that can be combined as steps in a workflow.
- **Runner**: A server that runs your workflows.

### Basic Example

Here is a simple workflow that runs on every push to the repository:

```yaml
name: CI Example
on: [push]
jobs:
	build:
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		steps:
			- uses: actions/checkout@v4
			- name: Run a one-line script
				run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"
```

### Getting Started

1. Create a `.github/workflows/` directory in your repository.
2. Add a YAML file (e.g., `first-example.yml`) with your workflow definition.
3. Push your changes to GitHub. The workflow will run automatically based on the triggers you define.
